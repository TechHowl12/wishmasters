        This refund and cancellation policy outlines how you can cancel or seek
        a refund for a product / service that you have purchased through the
        Platform. Under this policy: Cancellations will only be considered if
        the request is made 3 days of placing the order. However, cancellation
        requests may not be entertained if the orders have been communicated to
        such sellers / merchant(s) listed on the Platform and they have
        initiated the process of shipping them, or the product is out for
        delivery. In such an event, you may choose to reject the product at the
        doorstep. WISHMASTERS GAMING TECHNOLOGIES PRIVATE LIMITED does not
        accept cancellation requests for perishable items like flowers,
        eatables, etc. However, the refund / replacement can be made if the user
        establishes that the quality of the product delivered is not good. In
        case of receipt of damaged or defective items, please report to our
        customer service team. The request would be entertained once the seller/
        merchant listed on the Platform, has checked and determined the same at
        its own end. This should be reported within 3 days of receipt of
        products. In case you feel that the product received is not as shown on
        the site or as per your expectations, you must bring it to the notice of
        our customer service within 3 days of receiving the product. The
        customer service team after looking into your complaint will take an
        appropriate decision. In case of complaints regarding the products that
        come with a warranty from the manufacturers, please refer the issue to
        them. In case of any refunds approved by WISHMASTERS GAMING TECHNOLOGIES
        PRIVATE LIMITED, it will take 1 days for the refund to be processed to
        you.
